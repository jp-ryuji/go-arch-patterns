# go-sample

This is a sample repository showcasing the Ports and Adapters architectural pattern (also known as Hexagonal Architecture) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) methodology, with a focus on fundamental concepts such as value objects. For more details about the software architecture, see [Software Architecture](docs/software_architecture.md).

The system represents a SaaS platform for car rental companies. For more details about the system, see [Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/er-diagram.md).

## Key Implementation Examples

This repository demonstrates the following software engineering concepts:

- **Value Object**:
  - *Definition*: See [Email value object](internal/domain/model/value/email.go) with [tests](internal/domain/model/value/email_test.go)
  - *Usage*: See [Individual entity](internal/domain/model/individual.go) using the Email value object
- **Polymorphic Association**: See [Renter model](internal/domain/model/renter.go) representing either Individual or Company entities

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. It is not recommended for production use without significant modifications.

1. **Database Schema Management**: The project uses GORM's AutoMigrate feature to manage database schema changes for convenience. Proper migration strategies should be implemented for production environments. For more details on how database schema updates are handled, see [Database Schema Updates](docs/database_schema_updates.md).

2. **Database Security**: SSL mode is disabled for database access (see [internal/infrastructure/postgres/client.go](internal/infrastructure/postgres/client.go)). This configuration is insecure and should be enabled in production environments.
